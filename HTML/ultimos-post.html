                It seems that there’s one word which is quite literally on everyone’s lips at the moment. The coronavirus or Covid-19 has instilled new meaning to the term “going viral” and the World Health Organisation has finally classified the global spread of this
                new kid on the block as a pandemic. Remove the middle three letters from this word and ironically, you’re left with “panic” which is perhaps the most immediate and obvious side-effect of the outbreak so far. Uncertainty is the oxygen that
                fuels this. Which is why we want to make sure that we provide our members with accurate up to date advice and guidance. And what we’re hearing is that you want to know how best to protect yourselves and your loved ones. We spoke with Dr.
                Sarah Hattam, who has supported us over the years in creating evidence backed content about wellbeing and health. Dr. Sarah has 25 years’ experience and is on a mission to fight the pseudo-science in the industry. She is passionate about
                sharing information that is backed by the latest science and research about how our human bodies and brains really thrive. This is what she had to say: First and foremost, it’s critical that we all follow the government’s advice which
                you can find here if you're living in the UK. Please make sure to follow the guidelines to help reduce the spread of the virus and help to flatten the curve.
